## 💎 Core Value & Market Scarcity

Mail-To addresses a critical gap in digital communication: the ability to prove delivery and integrity without sacrificing privacy or relying on centralized trust.

> **"How do you mathematically verify: 'I sent it', 'You received it', and 'The content is exactly as intended'?"**

We achieve this through a unique architectural combination:

1.  **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Content is encrypted on the client; the infrastructure provider never has access to the keys or plaintext.
2.  **Self-Hostable Sovereignty**: Users retain absolute control over their communication nodes and data governance.
3.  **Cryptographic Proof (Optional)**: Anchoring hashes to a public ledger (Solana) provides a neutral, third-party verifiable timestamp of existence and integrity.

This is a **High-Integrity Communication Protocol** designed for:
*   **Official Notifications**: Verifiable delivery of notices, alerts, and instructions.
*   **Compliance & Audit**: Maintaining a tamper-proof trail of sensitive data transfers.
*   **Digital Provenance**: Anchoring original work and IP before external disclosure.

## 🏗️ Architecture Maturity

*   **Global Edge**: Powered by Cloudflare Workers for low-latency, stateless execution.
*   **Atomic Consistency**: Durable Objects manage delivery state to prevent race conditions.
*   **Standard Crypto**: Built on TweetNaCl (XSalsa20-Poly1305) for audited, high-speed encryption.
